## installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Hotel Demand data from July 2015 to July 2017 to better understand:

1. How was the daily rate fluctuating during the whole year?
2. Are the rate trends for different hotel types the same?
3. What are major difference between resort and city hotels?
4. Can I predict cancellation rate to see what are key factors leading to cancellation?

## File Description
There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. All of the questions are solved in sequence of above question list. The notebook includes data and package loading, exploratory analysis, data cleaning, transformation to solve problems and whole process of building predictive models.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rensiningaria/how-to-enjoy-luxury-hotel-perfectly-by-analyzing-hospitality-data-af08fd0ea769).
